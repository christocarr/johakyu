			<p className="mt-5">Jo-Ha-Kyū… The rhythmic cycle of flow that permeates Japanese culture. With this feeling at its core, Jo-Ha-Kyū Arts was formed. Set up by long term Japan resident and multidisciplinary artist Verity Lane, Jo-Ha-Kyū Arts exists to showcase genre-defying works steeped in Asian culture, with particular emphasis on contemporary East Asian Arts - namely Japan - to a global stage. We aim to celebrate diversity, transcend social barriers, challenge public perceptions and smash stereotypes to bring forth new and exciting ways to inspire our audiences. Heightened creativity steeped in traditional Eastern aesthetics, our high quality works promise to be an immersive experience for those who dare…</p>
